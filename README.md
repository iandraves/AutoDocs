<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I made autodocs after spending hours of my time manually going through OpenEvidence to download and sort evidence for policy debate. As soon as I thought of automating the process I knew it was the perfect project for a short Python script. My high school debate team ended up using autodocs in the 2020-21 season and it saved us a tremendous amount of time. I hope it does the same for you!
